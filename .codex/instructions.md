# What you asked for in the README.md that hasnt been provided yet:

**Please send:**

1. Exact CSV field names to extract (and preferred output order).
    - For some reason all the raw CSV's have messed up header alignment (these are autogenerated by drone software during flight)
    - The project name is listed in cell A2
    - Column headers start on row 3
    - Column L has misplaced values and is missing the header that is supposed to be within L3. 
    - Both columns seem to also have random values in rows 2 and 3
    - *We need to first correct the CSV alignment and make sure the header row is labeled correctly. Header in L3 should be "PPM"*
    - **We can ignore columns B, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, R, and S**
    - **we EXTRACT values in columns A, C, D, E, L, and N**
    - I HAVE MANUALLY CREATED AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE CSV SHOULD LOOK ONCE CORRECTIONS ARE MADE AND COLUMNS ARE IGNORED WITHIN .CODEX\test-extract\desired-fields\

2. The Lat/Lon column names (for KMZ lookups).
    - Deatiled above and exampels shown in both raw csv and desired csv examples in .CODEX\test-extract\




4. Whether you also want a CSV output in addition to XLSX.
    - I'd prefer to only have an xlsx file

**What CODEX will then fill in:**

csv_schema.py (canonical headers/renames/derived fields),

csv_parser.py (strict selection & typing),

kmz_lookup.py (polyline name lookup using a spatial index),

xlsx_writer.py (any extra formattingâ€”autosizing columns, header styles, etc.).
